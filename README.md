# Yahoo IPO - Corporate Finance

Scrapes Yahoo finance for IPO (Initial Public Offerings) daily data. The data goes as far back as 2000 and collects IPOs worldwide, I filter the data down to specific countries and compute the average one day return for the U.S.

QUOTE: "In the 1980s, the average first-day return on initial public offerings (IPOs) was 7%. The
average first-day return doubled to almost 15% during 1990-1998, before jumping to 65%
during the internet bubble years of 1999-2000 and then reverting to 12% during 2001-2003."

I extended this research up to 2018, as far as I can remember the average one day returns from 2000 - 2018 were 15%.

-  Â¡Cuidado! - Careful: This is Yahoo finance free data, with open and close prices. There exists better resources for this kind of data (Bloomberg terminal, WRDS etc.).
