# Yahoo IPO - Corporate Finance

Scrapes Yahoo finance for IPO (Initial Public Offerings) daily data. The data goes as far back as 2000 and collects IPOs worldwide, I filter the data down to specific countries and compute the average one day return to test if each market has a 12% - 15% first day IPO return.

See J.R.Ritter for other IPO data. https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/ipo-data/

- Careful: This is Yahoo finance free data, with open and close prices. There exists better resources for this kind of data (Bloomberg terminal, WRDS etc.
